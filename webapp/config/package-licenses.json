That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent\n"},"ajv@6.12.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv","publisher":"Evgeny Poberezkin","path":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/ajv","licenseFile":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/ajv/LICENSE","fullLicenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017 Evgeny Poberezkin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The mobile webapp is available [here](https://budget-book-7ebd4.web.app). Don't forget to add it to your home screen 😄\n\n\n## Getting started \nThe app helps in several ways to track and manage your income and expenses.\nThis begins with the initial setup:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RBsSsWS.png)\n\nHere you have to decide wether to start fresh or from a previously exported BudgetP save file. These save files can be created at any time manually.\n\nThe next step is adding some transactions. Here BudgetP differentiates between income and expenses. Both are saved as a transaction:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eqXlaNB.png)\n\nAfter having saved your transactions, the charts start to fill themselves from the entered data. BudgetP currently offers two break downs, by category and over time:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cCpfl5n.png)\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sduUOaX.png)\n\nYou can gain further insight by filtering your list using the search. You can enter free text oder search against any of the categories you have created. Besides that you can check on a monthly or yearly level and using the charts compare the results with the previous year or month.\n\nIf you want to backup your saved transactions, you can hit the export button on the top right. It is going to promt you to select a location for your save file. After the export the save file can then be loaded again, when initially opening the app for the first time (i.e. on a new computer). In the future it is algo going to be possible to alyway save to an external file, so you can easily share it between devices with a service like OneDrive or Google Drive.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QHefOVR.png)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Local Development\n\n1.

Trademarks.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

If you are instead interested in using a Node.js\nSDK which grants you admin access from a privileged environment (like a server),\nyou should use the\n[Firebase Admin Node.js SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n## Get the code (browser)\n\n### Script include\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize download size by only including the scripts you need.\n\nInclude Firebase in your web application via a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${JSCORE_VERSION}/firebase.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({\n    apiKey: '<your-api-key>',\n    authDomain: '<your-auth-domain>',\n    databaseURL: '<your-database-url>',\n    projectId: '<your-cloud-firestore-project>',\n    storageBucket: '<your-storage-bucket>',\n    messagingSenderId: '<your-sender-id>'\n  });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\n_Note: To get a filled in version of the above code snippet, go to the\n[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your app and click on \"Add\nFirebase to your web app\"._\n\n### npm bundler (Browserify, Webpack, etc.)\n\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize bundle size by only importing the features you need.\n\nThe Firebase JavaScript npm package contains code that can be run in the browser\nafter combining the modules you use with a package bundler (e.g.,\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)).\n\nInstall the Firebase npm module:\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using ES6 imports or TypeScript:\n\n```js\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase';\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\n### Include only the features you need\n\nThe full Firebase JavaScript client includes support for Firebase Authentication, the\nFirebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Including\ncode via the above snippets will pull in all of these features.\n\nYou can reduce the amount of code your app uses by just including the features\nyou need. The individually installable services are:\n\n- `firebase-app` - The core `firebase` client (required).\n- `firebase-auth` - Firebase Authentication (optional).\n- `firebase-database` - The Firebase Realtime Database (optional).\n- `firebase-firestore` - Cloud Firestore (optional).\n- `firebase-storage` - Firebase Storage (optional).\n- `firebase-messaging` - Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional).\n- `firebase-functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions (optional).\n\nFrom the CDN, include the individual services you use (include `firebase-app`\nfirst):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-auth.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-database.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-storage.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-messaging.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-functions.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen using the firebase npm package, you can `require()` just the services that\nyou use:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase/app');\nrequire('firebase/auth');\nrequire('firebase/database');\n\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with the npm package, you can import just the\nservices you use:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace along with all its type information.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_The type information from the import statement will include all of the SDKs,\nnot just the ones you have `required`, so you could get a runtime error if you\nreference a non-required service._\n\n## Get the code (Node.js - server and command line)\n\n### NPM\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many\ndevelopers want to write server applications or command-line utilities using the\nNode.js JavaScript runtime.\n\nYou can use the same npm module to use Firebase in the Node.js runtime (on a\nserver or running from the command line):\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are using native ES6 module with --experimental-modules flag (or Node 12+)\nyou should do:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_Known issue for typescript users with --experimental-modules: you have to set allowSyntheticDefaultImports to true in tsconfig.json to pass the type check. Use it with caution since it makes the assumption that all modules have a default export, which might not be the case for the other dependencies you have. And Your code will break if you try to import the default export from a module that doesn't have default export._\n\nFirebase Storage is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[`google-cloud` Node.js client](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node).\n\n```\n$ npm install --save google-cloud\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access your Storage bucket using:\n\n```js\nvar gcloud = require('google-cloud')({ ... });\nvar gcs = gcloud.storage();\nvar bucket = gcs.bucket('<your-firebase-storage-bucket>');\n...\n```\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[Firebase Cloud Messaging Rest API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message).\n\n## API definition\n\nIf you use the\n[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) or\ncompatible IDE, you can find API definitions for all the Firebase JavaScript API\nin the included `/externs` directory in this package:\n\n```\nexterns/\n  firebase-app-externs.js\n  firebase-auth-externs.js\n  firebase-database-externs.js\n  firebase-firestore-externs.js\n  firebase-storage-externs.js\n  firebase-messaging-externs.js\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe Firebase changelog can be found at\n[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js).\n\n## Browser/environment compatibility\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).\n"},"fs-extra@9.0.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra","publisher":"JP Richardson","email":"jprichardson@gmail.com","path":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/electron-updater/node_modules/fs-extra","licenseFile":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/electron-updater/node_modules/fs-extra/LICENSE","fullLicenseText":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2017 JP Richardson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\n(the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,\n merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling\n"},"idb@3.0.2":{"licenses":"ISC","repository":"https://github.com/jakearchibald/indexeddb-promised","publisher":"Jake Archibald","path":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/idb","licenseFile":"/Users/danielfritz/Documents/GitHub/Budget-Book/node_modules/idb/LICENSE","fullLicenseText":"ISC License (ISC)\nCopyright (c) 2016, Jake Archibald <jaffathecake@gmail.com>\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).\n\n## API\n\n### Parsing\n\n\tURI.parse(\"uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  scheme : \"uri\",\n\t//  userinfo : \"user:pass\",\n\t//  host : \"example.com\",\n\t//  port : 123,\n\t//  path : \"/one/two.three\",\n\t//  query : \"q1=a1&q2=a2\",\n\t//  fragment : \"body\"\n\t//}\n\n### Serializing\n\n\tURI.serialize({scheme : \"http\", host : \"example.com\", fragment : \"footer\"}) === \"http://example.com/#footer\"\n\n### Resolving\n\n\tURI.resolve(\"uri://a/b/c/d?q\", \"../../g\") === \"uri://a/g\"\n\n### Normalizing\n\n\tURI.normalize(\"HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html\") === \"http://abc.com/~smith/home.html\"\n\n### Comparison\n\n\tURI.equal(\"example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D\", \"eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d\") === true\n\n### IP Support\n\n\t//IPv4 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//192.068.001.000\") === \"//192.68.1.0\"\n\n\t//IPv6 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]\") === \"//[2001:0:db8::1]\"\n\n\t//IPv6 zone identifier support\n\tURI.parse(\"//[2001:db8::7%25en1]\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  host : \"2001:db8::7%en1\"\n\t//}\n\n### IRI Support\n\n\t//convert IRI to URI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://examplé.org/rosé\")) === \"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"\n\t//convert URI to IRI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"), {iri:true}) === \"http://examplé.org/rosé\"\n\n### Options\n\nAll of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:\n\n*\t`scheme` (string)\n\n\tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.\n\n*\t`reference` (string)\n\n\tIf set to `\"suffix\"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.\n\n*\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.\n\n*\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.\n\n*\t`iri` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).\n\n## Scheme Extendable\n\nURI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
