For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst zipFilePath = await download('4.0.4', {\n  mirrorOptions: {\n    mirror: 'https://mirror.example.com/electron/',\n    customDir: 'version-{{ version }}',\n    platform: 'linux',\n    arch: 'x64'\n  }\n});\n// Will download from https://mirror.example.com/electron/version-4.0.4/electron-v4.0.4-linux-x64.zip\n```\n\n#### Using environment variables for mirror options\nMirror options can also be specified via the following environment variables:\n* `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_DIR` - Specifies the custom directory to download from.\n* `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_FILENAME` - Specifies the custom file name to download.\n* `ELECTRON_MIRROR` - Specifies the URL of the server to download from if the version is not a nightly version.\n* `ELECTRON_NIGHTLY_MIRROR` - Specifies the URL of the server to download from if the version is a nightly version.\n\n### Overriding the version downloaded\n\nThe version downloaded can be overriden by setting the `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_VERSION` environment variable.\nSetting this environment variable will override the version passed in to `download` or `downloadArtifact`.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis module downloads Electron to a known place on your system and caches it\nso that future requests for that asset can be returned instantly.  The cache\nlocations are:\n\n* Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache/electron/`\n* MacOS: `~/Library/Caches/electron/`\n* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/electron/Cache` or `~/AppData/Local/electron/Cache/`\n\nBy default, the module uses [`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) as the\ndownloader. As a result, you can use the same [options](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options)\nvia `downloadOptions`.\n\n### Progress Bar\n\nBy default, a progress bar is shown when downloading an artifact for more than 30 seconds. To\ndisable, set the `ELECTRON_GET_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable to any non-empty value, or set\n`quiet` to `true` in `downloadOptions`. If you need to monitor progress yourself via the API, set\n`getProgressCallback` in `downloadOptions`, which has the same function signature as `got`'s\n[`downloadProgress` event callback](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#ondownloadprogress-progress).\n\n### Proxies\n\nDownstream packages should utilize the `initializeProxy` function to add HTTP(S) proxy support. If\nthe environment variable `ELECTRON_GET_USE_PROXY` is set, it is called automatically. A different\nproxy module is used, depending on the version of Node in use, and as such, there are slightly\ndifferent ways to set the proxy environment variables. For Node 10 and above,\n[`global-agent`](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#environment-variables) is used. Otherwise,\n[`global-tunnel-ng`](https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel#auto-config) is used. Refer to the\nappropriate linked module to determine how to configure proxy support.\n"},"@firebase/auth@0.14.6":{"licenses":"Apache-2.0","repository":"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk","publisher":"Firebase","email":"firebase-support@google.com","url":"https://firebase.google.com/","path":"C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Documents\\GitHub\\Budget-Book\\node_modules\\@firebase\\auth","licenseFile":"C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Documents\\GitHub\\Budget-Book\\node_modules\\@firebase\\auth\\LICENSE","fullLicenseText":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

If you are instead interested in using a Node.js\nSDK which grants you admin access from a privileged environment (like a server),\nyou should use the\n[Firebase Admin Node.js SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n## Get the code (browser)\n\n### Script include\n\nInclude Firebase in your web application via a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${JSCORE_VERSION}/firebase.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({\n    apiKey: '<your-api-key>',\n    authDomain: '<your-auth-domain>',\n    databaseURL: '<your-database-url>',\n    projectId: '<your-cloud-firestore-project>',\n    storageBucket: '<your-storage-bucket>',\n    messagingSenderId: '<your-sender-id>'\n  });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\n*Note: To get a filled in version of the above code snippet, go to the\n[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your app and click on \"Add\nFirebase to your web app\".*\n\n### npm bundler (Browserify, Webpack, etc.)\n\nThe Firebase JavaScript npm package contains code that can be run in the browser\nafter combining the modules you use with a package bundler (e.g.,\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)).\n\nInstall the Firebase npm module:\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using ES6 imports or TypeScript:\n\n```js\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase';\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\n### Include only the features you need\n\nThe full Firebase JavaScript client includes support for Firebase Authentication, the\nFirebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Including\ncode via the above snippets will pull in all of these features.\n\nYou can reduce the amount of code your app uses by just including the features\nyou need. The individually installable services are:\n\n- `firebase-app` - The core `firebase` client (required).\n- `firebase-auth` - Firebase Authentication (optional).\n- `firebase-database` - The Firebase Realtime Database (optional).\n- `firebase-firestore` - Cloud Firestore (optional).\n- `firebase-storage` - Firebase Storage (optional).\n- `firebase-messaging` - Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional).\n- `firebase-functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions (optional).\n\nFrom the CDN, include the individual services you use (include `firebase-app`\nfirst):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-auth.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-database.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-storage.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-messaging.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-functions.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen using the firebase npm package, you can `require()` just the services that\nyou use:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase/app');\nrequire('firebase/auth');\nrequire('firebase/database');\n\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with the npm package, you can import just the\nservices you use:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace along with all its type information.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_The type information from the import statement will include all of the SDKs,\nnot just the ones you have `required`, so you could get a runtime error if you\nreference a non-required service._\n\n## Get the code (Node.js - server and command line)\n\n### NPM\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many\ndevelopers want to write server applications or command-line utilities using the\nNode.js JavaScript runtime.\n\nYou can use the same npm module to use Firebase in the Node.js runtime (on a\nserver or running from the command line):\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are using native ES6 module with --experimental-modules flag, you should do:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace.\nimport firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_Known issue for typescript users with --experimental-modules: you have to set allowSyntheticDefaultImports to true in tsconfig.json to pass the type check. Use it with caution since it makes the assumption that all modules have a default export, which might not be the case for the other dependencies you have. And Your code will break if you try to import the default export from a module that doesn't have default export._\n\n\nFirebase Storage is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[`google-cloud` Node.js client](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node).\n\n```\n$ npm install --save google-cloud\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access your Storage bucket using:\n\n```js\nvar gcloud = require('google-cloud')({ ... });\nvar gcs = gcloud.storage();\nvar bucket = gcs.bucket('<your-firebase-storage-bucket>');\n...\n```\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[Firebase Cloud Messaging Rest API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message).\n\n## API definition\n\nIf you use the\n[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) or\ncompatible IDE, you can find API definitions for all the Firebase JavaScript API\nin the included `/externs` directory in this package:\n\n```\nexterns/\n  firebase-app-externs.js\n  firebase-auth-externs.js\n  firebase-database-externs.js\n  firebase-firestore-externs.js\n  firebase-storage-externs.js\n  firebase-messaging-externs.js\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe Firebase changelog can be found at\n[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js).\n\n## Browser/environment compatibility\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).\n"},"fs-extra@8.1.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra","publisher":"JP Richardson","email":"jprichardson@gmail.com","path":"C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Documents\\GitHub\\Budget-Book\\node_modules\\fs-extra","licenseFile":"C:\\Users\\Daniel\\Documents\\GitHub\\Budget-Book\\node_modules\\fs-extra\\LICENSE","fullLicenseText":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2017 JP Richardson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\n(the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,\n merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability."}}
